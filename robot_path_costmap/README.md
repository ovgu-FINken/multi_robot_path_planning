# Path costmap (by layer injection)
Welcome to multi-robot path planning with adapted costmaps based on path plans of the other robots! 

Its purpose is the path planning and collsion avoidance in multi-robot settings by making advantage of communicating and knowing the planned paths of the other robots.

This README helps you with the **setup and usage** of the code. If you are looking for information on the algorithm itself (research, implementation, benchmark performance etc.), please refer to the respective [wiki page](https://github.com/ovgu-FINken/multi_robot_path_planning/wiki/Implemented-Algorithms:-Collvoid).
